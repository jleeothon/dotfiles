# Dotfiles

Johnny's dotfiles.

## How it works

- Makes a `git` repo out of the home folder
- Files are not tracked unless added to `.gitignore`.
- Some files are kept "private" e.g. `.private.gitconfig` and synced with a (private) git submodule

## Installing

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jleeothon/dotfiles/master/.install.sh | bash
```
